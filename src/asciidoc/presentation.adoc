He carefully unpacked an 8080 processor kit board and connected a cassette tape drive.

As we spoke he started typing on the hex keypad.

After a while the cassette drive activated and loaded a program from tape.

He he had actually typed in the bootloader because his cheapest kit board didn't have a BIOS.

=== Impressed
[NOTE.speaker]

#4
To say the least I was impressed that he entered the bootloader without error.

I can't even remember the electronics project he wanted to show

Move forward 16 years.

It is 2 O'clock on a sunday morning.

The only thing that gets the weird taste out of your mouth is the plastic coffee from the machine.

We are waiting

We are once again waiting for someone to fix some firewall rule or database table or LDAP directory

=== How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#7
Why can't the changes go smooth

How do we change the world around us?

We have some goal in mind.

=== change determine current state
==== How do we change the world
[arabic]
. Determine current state

[NOTE.speaker]

#8
If our goal is to see and we cannot see because it is dark,
we locate and flick the light switch

#9
If the lights do come on we are happy.
If it doesn't come on we search for a light bulb or check the Internet for the load shedding schedule

=== verify new state
==== How do we change the world
[arabic]

. Verify new state

[NOTE.speaker]

#10
If we had to install a new bulb and it work when we turn if it on we are happy.
We verified the new state.

We also make sure the light doesn't flicker, throw sparks or catches fire.
We verified normal operation.

If there was a problem we would take out the bulb and try a new one.

If it doesn't work we don't keep flicking the switch or replacing light bulbs or breaking the house down.

=== complex tasks by hand
==== How do we change our software systems?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#13
When changing our software systems we expect people to perform complex tasks perfectly by hand.
We don't want some expert change the firewall or DBA updating tables.
--

[%notitle]
=== automation
==== How do we change our software systems?

Handrolics or Automation?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#14
If we just had something that could perform complex tasks repeatedly and accurately
We do! It is called Software!
--

=== Change automation
What is available?
[NOTE.speaker]
--
#15
We should have a simple command to execute or button to press to apply the changes.

What is available right now for changing our systems without needing the expert to apply the change.
--
=== Networking
* Programmable DNS
* Software Defined Networking
* Routers

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#16
Most cloud infrastructure systems provide routers and some kind of software defined networking.
You can add new hosts to the DNS and configure proper routes using a language like Python.
--

=== Database Migration
* Liquibase
* Flyway
* Mongobee
* Other

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#17
You can safely migrate your database structure when rolling out a new version of a program.
You can safely add new data and remove or modify existing data as needed.
--
=== Infrastructure Services
==== Cloud Platforms
* OpenStack
* Cloud Foundry

==== Immutable Servcers
* Containers
* Docker
* Kubernetes

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#18
You do not want to try and deploy or update an application in an application server.
You want to create new versions of your servers and start them when needed.
Then we can easily start more if load demands
--
=== Automated Software changes
* Ansible
* Chef
* Puppet

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

[NOTE.speaker]

#19
You want to define rules, constraints, prerequisites and commands to determine the current state,
to change to new state and to verify the end result.

You want to coordinate this over multiple servers, hosts and data centres.

I am not impressed by heroic system administrators or heroic programmers
I am not impressed by my friend typing the bootloader during our conversation
I am horrified
