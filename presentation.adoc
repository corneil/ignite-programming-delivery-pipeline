30 years ago a friend asked me over he wanted to show me his electronics project.

=== 30 years ago

He carefully unpacked an 8080 processor kit board and connected a cassette tape drive.

As we spoke he started typing on the hex keypad.

=== Bootloader

```

After a while the cassette drive activated and loaded a program from tape.

He he had actually typed in the bootloader because his cheapest kit board didn't have a BIOS.
--
=== Impressed
[NOTE.speaker]
--
#4
To say the least I was impressed that he entered the bootloader without error.

I can't even remember the electronics project he wanted to show

Move forward 16 years.

=== 2 O'Clock

It is 2 O'clock on a sunday morning.

The only thing that gets the weird taste out of your mouth is the plastic coffee from the machine.

=== Waiting for ...

We are waiting

We are once again waiting for someone to fix some firewall rule or database table or LDAP directory

=== How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#7
Why can't the changes go smooth.

So how do we usually change the world around us?

We have some goal in mind.
--

[%notitle]
=== change determine current state
==== How do we change the world
[arabic]
. Determine current state

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#8
If our goal is to see and we cannot see because it is dark,
we locate and flick the light switch.
--

[%notitle]
=== modify to expected state
==== How do we change the world
[arabic]
. Determine current state
. Modify to expected state

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#9
If the lights do come on we are happy.
If it doesn't come on we search for a light bulb or check the Internet for the load shedding schedule
--

[%notitle]
=== verify new state
==== How do we change the world
[arabic]
. Determine current state
. Modify to expected state
. Verify new state

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#10
If we had to install a new bulb and it worked when we turned if it on we were happy.
We verified the new state.
--

[%notitle]
=== verify operation
==== How do we change the world
[arabic]
. Determine current state
. Modify to expected state
. Verify new state
. Verify operation

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#11
We also make sure the light doesn't flicker, throws sparks or catches fire.
We verified normal operation.
--

[%notitle]
=== rollback on error
==== How do we change the world
[arabic]
. Determine current state
. Modify to expected state
. Verify new state
. Verify operation
. Rollback on error

[NOTE.speaker]

#12
If there was a problem we would take out the bulb and try a new one.

If it didn't work we don't keep flicking the switch or replacing light bulbs or breaking the house down.

=== complex tasks by hand
==== How do we change our software systems?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#13
So when changing our software systems we expect people to perform complex tasks perfectly by hand.
Why? We don't want to rely on some expert to change the firewall or DBA updating tables by hand perfectly.
--

[%notitle]
=== automation
==== How do we change our software systems?

Handrolics or Automation?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#14
Won't it be more productive if a simple command and be used to do the job perfectly?
If we just had some way to perform complex tasks computer tasks repeatedly and accurately.
--

=== Change automation
What is available?
[NOTE.speaker]
--
#15
We should have a simple command to execute or button to press to apply the changes.

When we deploy or update systems we need to make certain types of changes. I wonder how we can make this simple.
--
=== Networking
* Programmable DNS
* Software Defined Networking
* Routes and Routers

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#16
We need to add new hosts to the DNS and configure proper routes and firewalls.
I think a language like Python may be a good option.
--

=== Database Migration
* Liquibase
* Flyway
* Mongobee

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#17
We need to migrate your database structure when rolling out a new version of a program.
We need to add new data and remove or modify existing data.
We need to revert these changes without waiting for hours to restore a backup.
--
=== Infrastructure Services
==== Cloud Platforms
* OpenStack
* Cloud Foundry

==== Immutable Servcers
* Containers
* Docker
* Kubernetes

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#18
We not want to try and deploy or update an application in an application server.
We want to create new versions of our servers and start them when needed.
We can then easily start more if load demands.
--
=== Automated Software changes
* Ansible
* Chef
* Puppet
[quote]
====
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
====

[NOTE.speaker]
--
#19
We want to define prerequisites, rules, constraints, and commands that can determine the current state,
to change to new state and to verify the end result.

And we want to coordinate this over multiple servers, hosts and data centres.

=== impressed-not
==== Impressed Not.
==== Horrified Yes.

[NOTE.speaker]

#20
I am not impressed by fireman system administrators and programmers
I am not impressed by my friend typing the bootloader during our conversation
I am horrified
